        Welcome to my favorite games!
    </h1>

    <p>
        There are three of my favorite games. I have been playing them for about three years. 
        If you are interested, you can play with me. 
    </p>

    <h4>Here is a brief introduction to these games.</h4>

    <div class="team">
        <!-- loop through all our team members and put their info on the page -->
        <!-- this is exactly like a forEach loop with plain JS -->
        {{#each  people}}
            <div class="user-panel">
                <img class="u-avatar"  src="images/{{avatar}}" alt="avatar">

                <a class="u-link" href="{{ID}}">
                    See More Info
                </a>

                <h1>{{CompanyName}}</h1>
                <h3><a href="{{URL}}">{{URL}}</a></h3>
            </div>
        {{/each}}
        
    </div>
